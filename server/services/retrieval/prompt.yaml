      - Prefer quoting exact text when available; otherwise, paraphrase concisely.

      User Query:
      {{ query }}

      Retrieved Documents:
      {% for d in documents %}
      - id: {{ d.id | default("n/a") }}
        source: {{ d.metadata.source | default("unknown") }}
        page: {{ d.metadata.page | default("n/a") }}
        score: {{ d.score | default("n/a") }}
        content: |
          {{ d.page_content }}
      {% endfor %}

      Please follow these steps:
      1) Determine if the documents contain sufficient information to answer the query.
      2) If yes, synthesize an answer grounded only in the documents.
      3) If partially sufficient, answer what you can and list open gaps.
      4) If insufficient, respond “I don’t know” and list what additional information would be needed.

      Output format:
      - A short, direct answer (3–8 sentences).
      - A bulleted list of key supporting points.
